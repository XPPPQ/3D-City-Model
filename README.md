# 3D-City-Model
City 3D models provide strong support for urban planning and government decision-making. Based on lidar data, this research generates urban 3D models through multiple processes such as cleaning, classification and identification.The modeling process mainly relies on the related functions of QGIS, and we will continue to upload it after converting to code in the future.This workflow was submitted for the 'Urban Analytics Group Project ' course, MSc in Urban Analytics, University of Glasgow.
